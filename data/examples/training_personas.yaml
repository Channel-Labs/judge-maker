    prison in upstate New York. Holds an M.A. in Islamic studies and a psychology
    certificate. Lives with rheumatoid arthritis in his hands (prefers voice dictation
    and short keyboard sessions). Fluent in Dari, Arabic recitation, and English;
    basic Spanish for Latino inmates. Deep scriptural knowledge but limited time for
    compiling bilingual worksheets, sourcing exact hadith references, and drafting
    trauma-informed counseling materials. Tech-savvy enough for Microsoft 365 and
    Zotero but wary of unverified online fatwas.
  personality: "Calm, reflective, warm yet firm. Values scholarly rigor, precise Arabic\
    \ citations (Surah:Ayah, Hadith book/number), and trauma-sensitive language. Prefers\
    \ clear section headings, bilingual (Arabic/English) side-by-side texts, and bullet-point\
    \ action plans. Dislikes sensationalism, vague platitudes, or misattributed sources.\
    \ Motivated by inmates\u2019 spiritual growth and ethical rehabilitation."
  scenario: "Preparing a six-week Friday khutbah series on forgiveness, restitution,\
    \ and personal transformation, Hamid seeks the AI\u2019s help to: compile Qur\u2019\
    an and Sahih hadith passages with verified citations; draft plain-English sermon\
    \ outlines and short Dari/Spanish summaries; design printable Arabic-English vocabulary\
    \ flash cards for new Muslim converts; create trauma-informed counseling worksheets\
    \ aligned with correctional policies; generate a volunteer-training manual with\
    \ do\u2019s & don\u2019ts; and format everything for large-print handouts to ease\
    \ his arthritis-related handwriting limits."
  summary: Scholarly prison chaplain needs precise bilingual Islamic sources and rehab
    materials.

  description: 42-year-old Vermont fantasy novelist with congenital prosopagnosia
    (face blindness) and chronic light-triggered migraines. Brilliant at mythic world-building,
    but often loses track of sub-plots, timelines, and character arcs. Uses Scrivener
    in dark-mode on a MacBook with tinted screen overlay; lightly tech-savvy but dislikes
    fiddly software setups. Recently landed a tentative agent who expects a polished,
    structurally sound manuscript draft in eight weeks. Limited social-media presence
    and scant marketing know-how.
  personality: Imaginative, introspective, mildly perfectionistic yet self-doubting.
    Values candid but compassionate feedback, concise bullet-point outlines, color-coded
    charts, and practical next-step checklists. Prefers visual aids and clear structure;
    easily overwhelmed by sprawling, unorganized notes. Appreciates migraine-friendly
    formatting (dark backgrounds, short paragraphs) and scheduling nudges to stay
    on deadline.
  scenario: "With her 140k-word epic draft due soon, Allie seeks the AI\u2019s help\
    \ to diagnose plot holes, streamline pacing, generate scene-by-scene summaries,\
    \ build relationship/chronology diagrams, craft query-letter hooks, plan a low-budget\
    \ pre-launch marketing timeline, and suggest blue-light-safe writing routines\
    \ and migraine mitigation strategies\u2014all delivered in visually organized,\
    \ face-reference-light formats that respect her prosopagnosia."
  summary: Imaginative migraine-prone novelist needs structured plot fixes and marketing
    roadmap.

    3G.
  personality: Methodical, culturally sensitive, perfectionistic; insists on correct
    IPA symbols, transparent sources, and data confidentiality. Prefers terse bullet
    points, Markdown tables, voice-dictation-friendly code snippets, and respectful
    language-rights framing.
  scenario: "Leila seeks the AI\u2019s help to auto-segment audio files, output orthographic\u2013\
    IPA transcriptions with glosses, build frequency lists and morphological paradigms\

  description: 30-year-old Colombian-American certified privacy professional (CIPP/US,
    CIPM) at a 200-employee U.S. tele-health start-up. Lives with systemic lupus (flares
    cause fatigue and joint pain) so works mostly remote with voice-dictation and
    an ergonomic trackball. Fluent English/Spanish; expert at policy analysis and
    vendor contract reviews but short on technical diagramming, staff-training design,
    and bilingual drafting under tight audit deadlines.
  personality: Detail-oriented, calm, risk-averse, and pragmatic. Prefers concise
    checklists, clear headings, and authoritative legal citations (GDPR Articles,
    HIPAA CFR sections). Values plain-language summaries after legalese, color-blind-friendly
    visuals, and time-boxed task plans that respect her health pacing. Dislikes vague
    guidance, uncited claims, or fluff.
  scenario: 'With a SOC 2 + HIPAA audit in six weeks and an EU product launch imminent,
    Andrea asks the AI to: 1) generate data-flow diagrams (Mermaid) mapping PHI across
    AWS microservices; 2) draft bilingual (English/Spanish) privacy notices and cookie
    banners compliant with GDPR/CCPA; 3) create a vendor DPIA template and risk matrix;
    4) compile lawful-basis justifications per processing purpose; 5) script a 20-slide
